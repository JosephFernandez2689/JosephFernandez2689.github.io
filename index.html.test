    <h3>About Me :)</h3>
    <p style="font-style:oblique;">life,pain and virtue</p>
    <font color="aqua"> Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, <strong> all of which have the potential to turn a life around</strong>!</font>
    <p style="font-style:oblique;">"We are our own universe" Author</p>
    <p style="font-style:cursive">We all have a difficult moment in where we are faced to accpte it has always be our choice in what we have become. That moment was when I made it to Mexico, a place where I did not know any of the cultur,langaueg,etc. A place that I call my origin
      but have no notion of anything here and how things are. It was hard too face a place where people have a different mind set and look at someone like my who has returned to Mexico from the USA. My essence was questioned I felt alone in the new strange
      place that is now my home. My first year in MX was not a good one, decieding whether i wanted to live or not.</p>
    <p style="font-style:oblique">I never wanted to go back the place I called home because it had failed me in a life changing way, turning there back on the people who serve and died for the country, my mind-set changed when i lost the person i loved and saw nothing was done to
      ensure there family was taken care for nor any proper way of compensation for her death (not that there is any). I lived in a constante torment for being helpless and always sabotaging my own life because I wanted to be miserable until i was faced
      with the option to resolve everything.</p>
    <p>I have not resolved everything but I'm still here and making the best of my life with my head cleared and calm that allows me to make the best of my life and always being positve and always bring a smile to whoever I meet.Improvise, Adapt, Overcome
      is what best describes me,I will break my head to find an answer or look for someone to help me.</p>
